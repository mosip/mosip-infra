# Uplading ID Schema
* Currently ID Schema version is not validated in Reg Proc
* Latest schema in `identity_schema` table is picked for validation.
* The schema id is automatically assigned.
* We just need to specify UI Spec json and ID Schema will be created automatically if upload/publish APIs are used.
