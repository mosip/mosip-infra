KEYCLOAK
* TODO: Mosip-admin-client of Keycload - the key needs to be updaded in properties file
* Run keycloak: 
 $ docker run -d -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 9000:8080 jboss/keycloak
* Keycloak webpage:
* mosip-admin-client (same in properties) needs to exist for user to successfully login in.
 But Role is not necessary for user.

http://<kubeslave ip>:<node port/auth/

* 
* Got the following wait message when tried quering for deployment status:

$ kubectl rollout status deployment/postgres

Waiting for deployment spec update to be observed...

* Checkout mosip/commmons repo on branch MOSIP-257

* To setup a cluster fresh, following instructions here:

https://www.tecmint.com/install-kubernetes-cluster-on-centos-7/

but start kubeadmn before kubelet.   kubeadmn will start kubelet 

* To disable swap,
$ sudo swapoff -a

Comment out the swap line from /etc/fstab (to permanently disable swap)

* Put console ip in /etc/hosts of each node (including master)
192.168.100.1 console

* Set up a local registry on console (localhost) and push kernel-config-server
to that registry which is picked from kernel-config-server POD in kubernets.
TODO: Automate this.  Follow instructions here:

https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/

###

When nodes stop and restart, the following needs to be done on each node:

$ sudo swapoff -a (only if swap still appears) 
$ sudo kubeadm init (ignore errors, only on Master, not needed on slave) 

* To connect to postgres
  * Get node port using  
   $  kubectl get service postgres

  * Get a worker/slave nodes ip from /etc/hosts of console (any worker node is fine)
   $ psql -h <node ip> -p <node port> -U postgres
   
   password: postgres 


*  Keycloak
^keycloak.* is not needed.

* Keycloak user account - Remove the condition to "Updated Password" for a user.

* Postgres DB mosip_iam needs an init to start Kernel Auth Service.
