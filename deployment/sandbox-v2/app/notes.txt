* Docker version:
  Docker version 18.09.7, build 2d0083d

* Ansible version
  ansible 2.9.4

* Install  openshift
  $ pip3 install openshift

* Python version
  python 3.6.8


* Installer python3 docker
  $ pip3 install docker 

KEYCLOAK
* Admin account:
  username: admin
  password: admin
* Run keycloak: 
  $ docker run -d -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 9000:8080 jboss/keycloak
* Keycloak webpage:
* mosip-admin-client (same in properties) needs to exist for user to successfully login in.
  But Role is not necessary for user.
*  Keycloak
  ^keycloak.* is not needed in properties files - they have to be defined, but ignored.
* Keycloak user account - Remove the condition to "Updated Password" for a user.

* Got the following wait message when tried quering for deployment status:
  $ kubectl rollout status deployment/postgres

  "Waiting for deployment spec update to be observed..."

   Had to restart nodes

* Front end URL needs to be added while installing docker.
  
* To setup a cluster fresh, following instructions here:
  https://www.tecmint.com/install-kubernetes-cluster-on-centos-7/

  but start kubeadmn before kubelet.   kubeadmn will start kubelet 

* To disable swap,
  $ sudo swapoff -a

  Comment out the swap line from /etc/fstab (to permanently disable swap)

###

When nodes stop and restart, the following needs to be done on each node:

  $ sudo swapoff -a (only if swap still appears) 
  $ sudo kubeadm init (ignore errors, only on Master, not needed on slave) 

* To connect to postgres
  * Get node port using  
   $  kubectl get service postgres

  * Get a worker/slave nodes ip from /etc/hosts of console (any worker node is fine)
   $ psql -h <node ip> -p <node port> -U postgres
   
   password: postgres 

* Postgres DB mosip_iam needs an init to start Kernel Auth Service.

TODO:
- Change all the k8s files to have Image pull policy as "Ifnotpresent"
- Write automation of building and pushing config server docker 
- Pv and PVC are immutable. Script fails while installing them again, so there existence must be checked.
- Automate Keycloak's service account role mapping (client - role mapping)
- The ips used in metallb need to be used for nginx ingress. (link)
- Automate role id update in properties
- Automate nginx setup (conf file)
- Insert the following line in master data valid_documents table (it will be available in 1.0.8)
 insert into valid_document (doctyp_code, doccat_code, lang_code,is_active, cr_by, cr_dtimes) values ('COE', 'POE', 'ara', true, 'superadmin', now());

- Have to restart Kernel auth if OTP is not received.  Needs to be fixed.
- HDFS:  name node runs on port 9000 for this docker.  Inside docker you have to do following:

  for:
   - regprocessor
   - prepreg
   - idrepo

===================
Installing Kuberntes using ansible on a fresh VM in TF cluster:

* Install ansible
a) sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
b) sudo yum install ansible # This will install 2.9 version

If you don't do (a), it will install ansible 2.4. But we need 2.9.

## Sandbox-v2 - Console
* Generate public and private keys as id_rsa and id_rsa.pub and cat the 
  contents of id_rsa.pub in authorized_keys file.
* sudo yum install python3
* sudo pip3 install openshift
* sudo pip3 install selinux
* sudo yum install postgresql (for psql client)
* change hosts ini file:
  * Update correct hostnames of master and works that will appear as labels
    in kubernetes
* Install psql version 10
  * sudo rpm -Uvh https://yum.postgresql.org/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos10-10-2.noarch.rpm
  * sudo yum install postgresql10
  
* checkout mosip/commons and mosip/pre-registration
* Update roles/postgres-init/defaults/main.yml for following:
  * pg_common_sql_path: /home/puneet/commons/db_scripts                         
  * pg_pre_reg_sql_path: /home/puneet/pre-registration/db_scripts

* Ingress:
  * Make sure metallB is installed with usable IPs
  * Nginx controller proxy buffer needs to be increased (has been done in the controller file)
  * Same needs to be done on external NGINX.

* Keycloak
  * Assign all roles to all clients (just for now). 
  * INDIVIDUAL role's id needs to be copied to kernel-qa.properties

* Masterdata
  * Master db access had to be changed to sysadmin:
```
   masterdata_database_username=sysadmin
   masterdata_database_password=Mosipadm@dev123
```

* Properties:
ApplicantType_Document_Mapping.json - not being used.


## Kubeworker 1
* create /mnt/mosip_data/postgre directory which must be empty.
* Install git
  * sudo yum install git
* For config server
  * create /mnt/mosip_data/config_repo dir.
  * Copy all property files from roles/config-server/files/properties to the above dir
  * git init 
  * git add .
  * git commit
  * CAUTION: An empty space is properties is not removed - be carefully if there is a space after a password string.   



PYTHON3:

Face some issues with python3.  Basically if Ansible interpreter is set to python3 then the same must be available 
on all machines.  However, centos 7 does not have the same enabled by default.  So, you can't use 
Ansible to install python!  Has to be installed with some other scripts or manually.
