# MOSIP Single Machine Installer

The scripts here enable a developer to run MOSIP modules on a single machine with very low memory configuration.  The module Jars are run directly without any containerization.  

This guide assumes familiarity with Linux systems.

## Running the Installer

1. This Installer runs on CentOS 7. Create a new VM with CentOS 7. The installer was tested with CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso with 8GB RAM, 2 CPU configuration.
1. Make sure network is enabled on the VM.
1. Create a new user. Login as this user.
1. Add current user to `/etc/sudoers` file.     
1. Install git:  
`$ sudo yum install -y git`
1. Create `mosip` directory in home directory.
1. `$ cd $HOME/mosip`
1. Clone this repo:    
`$ git clone https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra.git`  
1. Clone `mosip-platform` repo:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/mosip/mosip-platform.git`    
`$ cd mosip-platform`  
`$ git checkout 0.10.0_10232019_a`  

1. Install prerequisties (Python3.6 etc):  
`$ cd mosip-infra/deployment/developer`  
`$ sh prerequisites.sh`  
1. Logout, and login again as the same user (to avoid permission problems with docker).
1. (Optional) Create a snapshot of your VM at this point so that you can revert back quickly in case steps hereon fail for some reason.
1. Modify `$HOME/mosip/mosip-infra/deployment/developer/config_server/mosip_configs/kernel.properties` to add your Gmail account SMTP credentials in the following fields _(WARNING: Use a test Gmail account, as your password will be exposed below!)_     
`spring.mail.username=<user email id>`   
 `spring.mail.password=<password>`
1. Modify `$HOME/mosip/mosip-infra/deployment/developer/config_server/mosip_configs/registration-processor.properties` to add your Linux login user id here:  
`registration.processor.dmz.server.user=<your login id>` 
1. Run installer as below (do **not** run with `sudo`). Select default values.  Don't give any paraphrase if asked during key generation:  
`$ cd $HOME/mosip/mosip-infra/deployment/developer/launcher`  
`$ ./launcher.py --help`  
`$ ./launcher.py --install-environ` (one time)  
1. Run any *country specific* scripts now (optional)
1. Build and start services.  
`$ ./launcher.py --build-code`    
`$ ./launcher.py --start-services`  
1. Wait for services to come up.  The `top` utility will show CPU utilization of all java processes.  One indication of whether all services are up is when the CPU utilization of the respective processes goes low.
1. Monitor the logs under `launcher/logs` dir for any errors. If there is NullPointerException in any service, re-run the service using the script `utils/run_service.py`  
`$ grep ERROR *`  
`$ grep -i NullPointerException *`
1. Once all services are up, run a test api under `launcher/test/api_test.py` (inspect and modify the API parameters before running). For the OTP email test, you will have to allow Google to receive emails from apps (lesser security setting).  
`$ cd /test/`  
`$ python3.6 api_test.py`  

### HDFS Docker (debugging and inspection)
* To access the hdfs docker (for debugging or inspection), get the container id with:  
`$ docker container ls`
* `$ docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash`
* To list packets:  
`$ cd /usr/local/hadoop/bin`  
`$ ./hdfs dfs -ls /user/regprocessor`  
* To delete packet  
`$ ./hdfs dfs -rm -r -f /user/regprocessor/<packet directory>`
* HTTP interface of name node can be accessed via `http://localhost:50070`

### LDAP UI tool (optional)
- For inspecting contents of LDAP, download and install Apache Studio DS
http://directory.apache.org/studio/download/download-linux.html
- Create a new connection with following params: host = localhost, port = 10389, Simple Authentication, Bind DN = "uid=admin,ou=system", Bind password = "secret"

### Utils
A few useful scripts are available in `utils` folder:
* `add_user.py`:  Add a user, machine, center into DB and LDAP.
* `prop_comparator.py`:  Compare two property files.
* `run_service.py`:  Re-run a single service. 
* `reprocessor.py`:  To re-process any failed packets.

### Notes
* This version of installer runs selected modules of Pre-Reg and Reg Processor.  Further enahncements to the installer are in progress.  Developers are expected to learn the installation process using these reference scripts.
* Config server runs on port 8888 by default.  It may conflict with some services. TODO: Change the port.
* HDFS secure authentication is disabled, hence Kerberos is not used. 
* For local run all ports have to be different. Hence, the kernel services are run on ports 81xx.
* HTTPS connections have been changed to HTTP connection in code.
* Detailed logs have been redirected by changing code (path was hardcoded).
* Following change has been made in the `mosip-platform` code in `ConnectionUtils.java` to make HDFS work in single node docker mode:   
`configuration.set("dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname", "false");`
* Since we are not using Kubernetes cluster here, hazelcast_secure.xml is identical to hazelcast_dmz.xml.
* Two camel bridge instances are run - one for dmz and another one for secure zone.
* Self-signed SSL certificates have been generated using 'localhost' as domain name.  If you are accessing this installation from outside, create new certificate and key with IP/domain name of the machine and place in `/etc/ssl/` dir.
* If you modify master data and ID object for Arabic language, then make sure while using `vim` the mode is set to `:set rightleft` before cut-and-paste into `vim`.  Make sure the characters seen in DB are same as in ID object.
