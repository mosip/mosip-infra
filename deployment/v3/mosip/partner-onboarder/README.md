# Partner Onboarder

## Overview
Loads certs for default partners for sandbox. Refer [mosip-onboarding repo](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-onboarding).

## Install 
* Set `values.yaml` to run onboarder for specific modules.
* run `./install.sh`.
```
./install.sh
```
### Configurational steps after onboarding is completed.
* Onboarding the default mimoto-keybinding partner using below mentioned steps.
* After successfull partner onboarder run, html report containing detailed request and response bodies are saved inside `onboarder` bucket in minio.
* Get `apiKey` from  response body of  request `request-for-partner-apikey` from the report **_mimoto-keybinding.html_**.
* Update & commit  value of  `wallet.binding.partner.api.key`  parameter with `apiKey` value from last step in **mimoto-default.properties**.
* Restart mimoto pod.
* During the execution of the `install.sh` script, a prompt will appear inquiring about the presence of a public domain and a valid SSL certificate on the server. <br>
  In the event that the server does not possess a public domain and a valid SSL certificate, it is recommended to select option `n`. <br>
  By choosing this option, the `ENABLE_INSECURE` environment variable will be set to `true`, enabling the script to proceed with the download of an SSL certificate.
  This certificate can then be utilized for Newman collections and curl API calls throughout the execution.
  This particular functionality is intended for situations where the script needs to be employed on a server that utilizes self-signed SSL certificates.
# Troubleshootings

* After completion of the job, a very detailed `html report` is prepared and stored at https://onboarder.{sandbox_base_url}.mosip.net

* The user can go and view the same for more information or response messages.

### Commonly found issues 

 1. KER-ATH-401: Authentication Failed
 
    Resolution: You need to provide correct secretkey for mosip-deployment-client.
 
 2. Certificate dates are not valid

    Resolution: Check with admin regarding adding grace period in configuration.
 
 3. Upload of certificate will not be allowed to update other domain certificate
 
    Resolution: This is expected when you try to upload `ida-cred` certificate twice. It should only run once and if you see this error while uploading a second      time it can be ignored as the cert is already present.
