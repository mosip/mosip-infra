# Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing difficulties with sending or receiving emails, it is possible that the mail server of either the sender or receiver has blocked your mail server.
  For example:
  ```
  Hi. This is the James mail server at 0062d7fb41a3.
  I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
  This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.  Below
  I include the list of recipients and the reason why I was unable to deliver
  your message.
  
  Original email subject: as
  
  Failed recipient(s):
  syedsalman041997@gmail.com
  
  Error message:
  550-5.7.26 This mail has been blocked because the sender is unauthenticated.
  550-5.7.26 Gmail requires all senders to authenticate with either SPF or DKIM.
