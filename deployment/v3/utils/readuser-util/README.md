# ReadUser Creation Utility:

This Utility is used for the creation of user with readonly privilages for postgres, minio and keycloak server.

- This utility is designed to initialize MinIO with user management and policy attachment based on the specified action (create or delete).
- Also runs a script that creates a read-only user in a PostgreSQL database. 
- To Initialize keycloak with user with readonly privilages.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met before deploying the utility:

- Kubernetes Cluster: A running Kubernetes cluster.
- MinIO Deployment: MinIO server should be deployed and running.
- Postgres Deployment: Postgres server should be deployed and running.
- Keycloak Deployment: Keycloak server should be deployed and running.
- Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secrets:
    * Secret containing the "postgres-password"
    * Secret containing the MinIO access and secret keys.
- Configuration for the username, password, policy name, and action should be managed via a values file (typically used with Helm charts) for s3-readuser-util chart.
- Configuration for the username, password, dbhost, dbport and action should be managed via a values file (typically used with Helm charts) for postgres-readuser-util chart.
- readuser-init-values.yaml file with user configurations to initialize keycloak.

### Notes:

* The action (create or delete), username, password, and policy name should be set in the values.yaml file, which will be referenced in the Job manifest.
* The utility uses mc client to create readuser in minio server.
* The utility uses sql script which is passed in configmaps to create readuser in postgres server.
* If you want to create readuser then the "action" key value from values.yaml needs to be "create".
* If you want to delete readuser then the "action" key value from values.yaml needs to be "delete".
* Once after exicuting this utility please confirm from the minio, postgres and keycloak server whether the user created has the necessary privilages or not.
* And in case of deleteion of user crosscheck from the minio, postgres and keycloak server if the user is deleted or not.
