# Keycloak

## Introduction
An organisation may use any OAuth 2.0 compliant Identity Access Management (IAM) system with MOSIP.  Here we provide k8s installation procedure for **Keycloak** which is the default supported IAM with MOSIP.

- It is recommended to have two seperate installations of keycloak;
  1. One for organisation wide access to Rancher in order to access different clusters there which is already installed [here](../../rancher/keycloak/README.md). It is installed in the rancher cluster the same will be only one throughout the organisation.
  1. Second installation of keycloak will be in the MOSIP cluster as external dependency for every MOSIP cluster. This will be used by MOSIP modules for authentication and authorization.

## Prerequisites
The `install.sh` script here assumes that configmap `global` is already there in the default namespace. 

## Install
* Use the `install.sh` provided in this directory. This will install Keycloak as bitnami helm chart. 
* To further configure `values.yaml` and for any other info, refer [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/keycloak). 
```
$ ./install.sh <kubeconfig file for this cluster>
```
* Bitnami keycloak chart here installs postgres too.  If you already have an external postgres DB, point to the same while installing.
* For postgres persistence the chart uses default storage class available with the cluster.
* While deleting helm chart note that PVC, PV do not get removed for Statefulset. This also means that passwords will be same as before. Delete them explicity if you need to. CAUTION: all persistent data will be erased if you delete PV.
* To retain data even after PV deletion use a storage class that supports "Retain".  On AWS, you may install `gp2-retain` storage class given here and specify the same while installing Keycloak helm chart.

## Existing Keycloak
* In case you have not installed Keycloak by above method, and already have an instance running, make sure Kubernetes configmap and secret is created in namespace `keycloak` as expected in [keycloak-init](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-helm/blob/develop/charts/keycloak-init/values.yaml):
  ```
  keycloak:
    host:
      existingConfigMap: keycloak-host
      key: keycloak-host-url
    admin:
      userName:
        existingConfigMap: keycloak-env-vars
        key: KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER
      secret:
        existingSecret: keycloak
        key: admin-password
  ```

## Secret change
In case you change admin password directly from console, then update the secret as well:
```
$ ./update_secret.sh <admin new password> <kubeconfig file for this cluster>
```
You may get the current admin password:
```
$ ./get_pwd.sh <kubeconfig file for this cluster>
```

## Keycloak docker version
TODO: The keycloak docker version in `values.yaml` is an older version as the version 12.04 (latest bitnami) was crashing for `userinfo` request for client (like mosip-prereg-client). Watch latest bitnami release and upgrade 13+ version when available.

## Keycloak Init
To populate base data of MOSIP, run Keycloak Init job:
```
$ ./keycloak_init.sh <kubeconfig file for mosip cluster>
```

## Frontend URL
- Navigate to keycloak admin console.
- Navigate to `Mosip` realm.
- Configure *Frontend URL* property in *Realm Settings* page. Value for the frontend url should be: `https://<mosip-iam-external-host>/auth`. Eg: `https://iam.sandbox.mosip.net/auth`.
- Save it.

TODO: Automate this as part of keycloak-init
