# Postgres installation on Kubernetes cluster

## Install 
```sh
./install.sh
```
* A random password will get assigned for `postgres` user if you have not specified a password. The password may be obtained from Rancher console.

## Generate DB-Passwords
```sh
./db_password_gen.sh
```
* For each DB it will generate separate passwords.

## Test
* Make sure docker is running from machine you are testing.
* Postgres is accessible over "internal" channel, i.e. over Wireguard.  Make sure you have the Wireguard setup along with credentials to connect to internal load balancer.
* Connect to postgres:
```sh
docker run -it --rm postgres psql -h <hostname pointing to load balancer> -U postgres -p 5432
```
## Initialize DB
* Review `init_values.yaml` for  which DBs you would like to initialize.
* Run init postgres helm chart to create necessary DB, users, roles etc:
```sh
./init_db.sh
```
Be aware of version of helm chart corresponding to mosip version.

## Delete
Note that PVC and PV are not deleted after helm delete.  So if you would like to postgres again, make sure you delete PVC and PV.

## Init a specific DB
To initialized a specific db disable init of all others in `init_values.yaml` by settings `true` -> `false`.  Get db-user password with `get_pwd.sh`.  Provide the password in `init_values.yaml` and run `init_db.sh`.

## DB export

* Export all DB's to a single file via below command:
  ```
  pg_dumpall -c --if-exists -h <HOSTNAME> -p <PORT-NUMBER> -U <USERNAME> -f <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>.dump
  ```

## DB import

* Import DB's from backup file via below command:
  ```
  psql -h <HOSTNAME> -p <PORT-NUMBER> -U <USERNAME> -f <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>.dump
  ```


## Troubleshooting
* If you face login issues even when the password entered is correct, it could be due to previous PVC, and PV.  Delete them, but exercise caution as this will delete all persistent data.
* If you face below error while importing db's.
  ```
  psql:all-db-backup.dump:139: ERROR:  option "locale" not recognized                                             
  LINE 1: ...late1 WITH TEMPLATE = template0 ENCODING = 'UTF8' LOCALE = '...
  ```
  Then replace `LOCALE` with `LC_COLLATE` in `<BACKUP_FILE_NAME>.dump` file via sed command.
  ```
  sed -i 's/LOCALE/LC_COLLATE/g' <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>.dump
  ```
