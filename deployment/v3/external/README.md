# MOSIP External Components

This folder contains installation procedures for all components that are not part of core mosip offering - they need to be installed separately and integrated.  Mosip has provided reference/mock implementations of some of these components that may be used for development and testing.  Some components may run inside the cluster itself, or outside depending on choice of deployment.
