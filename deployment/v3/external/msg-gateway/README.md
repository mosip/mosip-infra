# Email and SMS gateways

The information of your Email and SMS gateways is created here.  Create these configmaps and secrets before installing [Config Server](../../mosip/config_server).  Even if you are not using any Email/SMS service, you still need to create these (with dummy values).

Run 
```sh
./install.sh
```
