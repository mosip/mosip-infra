# SMTP and SMS gateways

The information of your SMTP and SMS gateways is created here.  Create these configmaps and secrets before installing [Config Server](../../mosip/config_server).  Even if you are not using any Email/SMS service, you still need to create these (with dummy values).

If you would like to use Gmail SMTP. You can follow the procedure from [here](../../docs/create-gmail-app-password.md)

Run 
```sh
./install.sh
```
