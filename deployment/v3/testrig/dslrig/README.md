# DSLRIG

## Introduction
DSLRIG will test end-to-end functional flows involving multiple MOSIP modules.

## Prerequisites
* Packet utility running in rancher cluster exposed to be accessed by the cluster.
* Auth demo and DSLRIG to be running in the same cluster.
* NFS server already present and related details.

## Install
* Install
```sh
./install.sh
```
* During the execution of the `install.sh` script, a prompt appears requesting information regarding the presence of a public domain and a valid SSL certificate on the server.
* If the server lacks a public domain and a valid SSL certificate, it is advisable to select the `n` option. Opting it will enable the `init-container` with an `emptyDir` volume and include it in the deployment process.
* The init-container will proceed to download the server's self-signed SSL certificate and mount it to the specified location within the container's Java keystore (i.e., `cacerts`) file.
* This particular functionality caters to scenarios where the script needs to be employed on a server utilizing self-signed SSL certificates.

## Run dslrig manually

* There are two modes of dslrig `sanity` & `full`.
    * By default, dslrig will execute in `full` mode.
    * If you want to run dslrig with `sanity` mode, 
      Update the `TESTLEVEL` key in the `dslorchestrator` configmap and rerun the dslrig job.

#### CLI
* Download Kubernetes cluster `kubeconfig` file from `rancher dashboard` to your local.

* Install `kubectl` package to your local machine.
* Run dslrig manually via CLI by creating a new job from an existing k8s cronjob.
  ```
  kubectl --kubeconfig=<k8s-config-file> -n dslrig create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name>
  ```
  example: 
  ```
  kubectl --kubeconfig=/home/xxx/Downloads/qa4.config -n dslrig create job --from=cronjob/cronjob-dslorchestrator cronjob-dslorchestrator
  ```
